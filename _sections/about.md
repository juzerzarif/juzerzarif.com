Hi, my name is Juzer and I'm a Computer Engineering major at the University of Kansas. I'm originally from 
Mumbai, India. I'll be graduating from KU on May 2019 after which I'll be working as a Software Engineer at Cerner Corporation in Kansas City, MO. In my down time, I like to watch movies, listen to music, and take walks. I'm also somewhat of an audiophile although there's a lot I haven't discovered yet in that hobby. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me through any media you'd prefer. Have a great day!
