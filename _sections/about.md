Hi, my name is Juzer and I'm a Computer Engineering major at the University of Kansas. I'm originally from 
Mumbai, India. I'll be graduating from KU on May 2019 after which I'm looking for opportunities to grow as an 
engineering by applying my skills in the industry. In my down time, I like to watch movies, listen to music, and take walks. I'm also somewhat of an audiophile although there's a lot I haven't discovered yet in that hobby. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me through any media you'd prefer. Have a great day!
